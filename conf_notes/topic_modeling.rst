-  Machine Learning

    +  Supervised Learning (data has lables) vs Unsupervised (data has no lables)
    +  Supervised

        *  Categorized vs Quant

    +  Unsupervised

-  Topic Modeling

    +  Exploratory
    +  Looking for latent variables
    +  Clustering

        *  Hard Clustering
        *  Hierarchical Clustering
        *  Fuzzy Clustering: Topic modeling

            -  Each item can belong to more than one cluster

-  LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation): Popular Topic Modeling algorithm; Unsupervised Learning.

    +  Supervised Learning has it's OWN LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis).

    +  Iterative algorithm

-  Python Libraries

    +  Gensim; GraphLab; lda(Supervised Learning); sklearn

-  Preprocessing

    +  tokenization
        +  Simple, Collocations, Entities, combination, Lemmatization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)
    +  stopwords: language generic vs. domain specific
-  Vector Space

    +  Dictionary
    +  Bag of Words
