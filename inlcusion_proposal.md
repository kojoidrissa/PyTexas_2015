#Inlcusion Proposal DRAFT
##Building a More Inclusive Python Community

###Brief Description
An inclusive culture maximizes the odds of attracting and retaining skills & personalities a community needs to thrive. The Python community has a pretty good track record on issues related to inclusion. So, how can you help continue that trend, especially in your local community? I'll start with a brief *WHAT* and *WHY* of  Inclusion, but most of this talk focuses on **HOW** to help your local corner of the Python community be as Inclusive as possible.

###WHAT: Inclusion Defined
###WHY: Why does this matter to us?
###HOW: How do I DO this better?
-  Practicing Inclusivity 101: Building Awareness
-  Practicing Inclusivity 102: Taking Action
-  Practicing Inclusivity 103: Understanding The Power of Privilege


##Detailed Abstract
###WHAT: Inclusion Defined
-  Not about morality
-  Inclusion vs. Diversity vs. Political Correctness

###WHY: Why does this matter?
-  The Python community has a variety of needs, if it is to grow and thrive.  Different needs require different skills & personalities.
-  Inherent limits on community membership: not ALL 7 billion humans will join AND contribute
+  Inclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors

###HOW: How do I DO this better?
-  Check your assumptions
-  Zen of Python on Inclusiveness
    +  `Errors should never pass silently`
        +  Check for exceptions
        +  Discuss errors when they occur
    +  `In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess`: how much does the ambiguity matter?
+  Get out of your bubble
+  Flip the Demographics
+  Understanding The Power of Privilege
    *  Your Personal Privilege Matrix
    +  Privilege Arbitrage
    +  "Turn Your Sadness Into Kindness"

###Closing
#####What if you feel you can't?
If your heart's not really into it or you feel it's "too hard", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good.

Recognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.

#####It's up to all of us
