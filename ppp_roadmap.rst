Roadmap for building PPP visualizer
====

Version 0.5: MVP for PyTexas
----
-  visualization in iPython notebook
-  current example code has multiple "factors" on each graph

    +  Do I want 1 Profile per graph? Or do I want to have multiple profiles on a single graph, to better contrast?
    +  I'll try both, see which I like better. Two different "code bases".

Version 1.0: Can I get this to WORK?
----
-  One view/template/URL for the data input
-  One view/template/URL for the output
   
Version 2.0
----
-  Combine input and visualization in the same page
