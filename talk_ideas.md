##Let Your Freak Flag Fly: Developing Python Project Ideas
People often say the best way to learn to program or use a framework is to have a 'project'. But how do you come up with a project idea? One of the best ways is to focus on something you ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT, no matter how stupid it may sound. In this talk, I'll discuss some of MY stupid ideas that I've used to improve my Python and general programming skills. Hopefully this will inspire & encourage you to do the same. You couldn't POSSIBLY seem any crazier than me.
    -  Maybe as a lightning talk?
