Understanding Privilege
----
-  Privilege: What you DON'T have to worry about
-  Even the MOST privileged (US born white cishetero men) have a LOT to worry about

    +  How will I keep my $100K job that pays for my suburban home, 2 late model vehicles and "comfortable" lifestyle? 
    +  Do I even LIKE this life?
    +  Looking at Maslow's Heirarchy, LOTS of those concerns aren't survival/safety issues.

-  Compare/contrast white cishetero man with:

    +  his wife
    +  his wife's twin, who's husband was a jerk & now she's a single mom
    +  his male co-worker of color
    +  ANYONE not cishetero

        *  distinguish b/w Gay, Bi, Trans, Poly, others

-  People with LESS privilege have SIMILAR things to worry about, PLUS the added concerns that come with less privilege.
-  Privilege Arbitrage: Using YOUR freedom to avoid certain concerns to benefit people who CANNOT avoid them.
